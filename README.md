# reprocess-challenge-jh

#Description

First challenge for bootcamp where we reprocess old code into a more modern format. I have updated the format of the html and css by creating more specific html elements like header, section, subsection, nav, aside, and footer. The css has also been updated to reflect the changes in the html and reduce erroneous code in the css.

The application is an outdated webpage that has been update with modern styling and html elements.

Project has no licensing.

I, Jacob Hairfield, am the only author of the edits.
